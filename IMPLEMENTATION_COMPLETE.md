## Testing Instructions

To test the changes:

1. **Start the API Server:**
   ```bash
   cd src/SuperQA.Api
   dotnet run
   ```

2. **Start the Client:**
   ```bash
   cd src/SuperQA.Client
   dotnet run
   ```

3. **Test the UI:**
   - Navigate to `/extension-test-review`
   - Verify Save/Delete buttons are in Generated Script section
   - Generate a test script
   - Execute the test
   - If it fails, click "Heal Test with AI"
   - Verify healed script appears
   - Test Apply/Discard functionality

4. **Test the API:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:7000/api/playwright/heal-test \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "testScript": "original script",
       "errorMessage": "Element not found",
       "executionLogs": ["Click timeout..."],
       "apiKey": "sk-...",
       "model": "gpt-4o-mini"
     }'
