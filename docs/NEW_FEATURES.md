# SuperQA - New Features Summary

## Recent Enhancements

### 1. Settings Management

SuperQA now includes a dedicated **Settings** page where you can securely configure your preferences:

- **OpenAI API Key Storage**: Save your API key securely (encrypted in database)
- **AI Model Selection**: Choose from GPT-4o Mini, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, or GPT-3.5 Turbo
- **Playwright Browser Mode**: Configure headless/headed mode for test execution
- **Auto-Load Settings**: Saved settings are automatically used when generating tests

**Access Settings**: Navigate to `/settings` or click "Settings" in the navigation menu.

### 2. Browser Extension Integration

Generate Playwright tests directly from browser extension recordings:

- **Single-Click Import**: Send recorded steps and locators to SuperQA
- **Automatic Prompt Generation**: AI creates test scripts from your recorded interactions
- **Smart Locator Handling**: Uses actual DOM selectors from your application
- **Flexible API**: RESTful endpoint for easy integration

**API Endpoint**: `POST /api/playwright/generate-from-extension`

See [Browser Extension Integration Guide](docs/BROWSER_EXTENSION_INTEGRATION.md) for detailed documentation.

- **Gradient Themes**: Beautiful purple gradient color scheme throughout
- **Modern Cards**: Sleek cards with shadows and hover effects
- **Enhanced Typography**: Better font hierarchy and readability
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on all screen sizes
- **Smooth Animations**: Subtle transitions and micro-interactions
- **Professional Icons**: Bootstrap Icons for consistent visual language

## Configuration

### API Key Management

**Option 1: Save in Settings (Recommended)**
1. Navigate to Settings
2. Enter your OpenAI API key
3. Select AI model
4. Click "Save Settings"
5. Settings will be used automatically

**Option 2: Per-Request**
- Enter API key directly in Playwright Generator
- Not saved, used only for current session

### Browser Mode

Configure in Settings:
- **Headless Mode**: Browser runs invisibly (faster, production-ready)
- **Headed Mode**: Browser window visible (debugging, demonstrations)

### AI Model Selection

Choose the right model for your needs:
- **GPT-4o Mini**: Best balance of quality, speed, and cost (recommended)
- **GPT-4o**: Most capable, highest quality
- **GPT-4 Turbo**: Fast and cost-effective
- **GPT-3.5 Turbo**: Fastest and most economical

## Usage Examples

### Using Settings
```csharp
// Settings are automatically loaded
// No need to enter API key each time
// Just enter FRS and generate!
```

### Browser Extension Integration
```javascript
// Send from extension
fetch('https://localhost:7001/api/playwright/generate-from-extension', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    applicationUrl: 'https://example.com',
    steps: [
      { action: 'click', locator: '#login', description: 'Click login' }
    ]
  })
});
```

## Migration Notes

### Upgrading from Previous Versions

1. **Database**: If using SQL Server, run migrations to add UserSettings table
2. **Configuration**: No breaking changes to existing settings
3. **API Keys**: Existing API key usage in Playwright Generator still works
4. **Browser Mode**: Defaults to development settings (non-headless in dev)

### Breaking Changes
None - all changes are backward compatible.

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Storage**: Keys are stored in database with encryption
2. **HTTPS Required**: Use HTTPS in production for secure communication
3. **CORS**: Configure AllowedOrigins for browser extension integration
4. **Access Control**: Consider adding authentication for production use

## Performance Improvements

- Reduced token usage with optimized prompts
- Cached settings to minimize database calls
- Async operations throughout
- Efficient in-memory database for development

## Future Enhancements

- Browser extension development (official SuperQA recorder)
- Team collaboration features
- Test suite management
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- CI/CD integration templates
- Multi-user support with authentication
