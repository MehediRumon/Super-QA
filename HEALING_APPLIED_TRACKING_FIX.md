# Fix Summary: AI Healing Applied Tracking

## Problem Statement
"Still change corrected code or locators after AI heal"

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred because the AI healing system was saving healing history records as "successful" immediately after generating the healed script, even before the user decided to apply it to the test case. This created the following problem:

1. **Step 1**: User initiates AI healing for a failed test
2. **Step 2**: AI generates a healed script with new locators
3. **Step 3**: System saves healing history with `WasSuccessful = true`
4. **Step 4**: User views the healed script but decides NOT to apply it
5. **Step 5**: Test fails again with the same error
6. **Step 6**: User tries to heal again
7. **Problem**: AI tries to preserve locators from Step 2 that were never actually applied to the test case!

This resulted in the AI being constrained by locators that were never part of the actual test script, leading to incorrect healing attempts.

## Solution Implemented

Added a new `WasApplied` property to the `HealingHistory` entity to distinguish between:
- **Generated healings**: AI has generated a healed script (WasSuccessful=true, WasApplied=false)
- **Applied healings**: User has actually applied the healed script to the test case (WasSuccessful=true, WasApplied=true)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Entity Model (`HealingHistory.cs`)
- Added `WasApplied` boolean property (default: false)
- Added `AppliedAt` nullable DateTime property to track when the healing was applied

#### 2. AI Healing Service (`AITestHealingService.cs`)
- Modified healing history query to only consider healings where `WasApplied = true`
- Set `WasApplied = false` when creating new healing history records
- This ensures only actually-applied healings are used for locator protection

#### 3. Test Execution Service (`TestExecutionService.cs`)
- Updated `UpdateTestCaseAutomationScriptAsync` to accept an optional `executionId` parameter
- When executionId is provided, the method finds the corresponding healing history and marks it as applied
- Sets `WasApplied = true` and `AppliedAt = DateTime.UtcNow`

#### 4. API Controller (`TestExecutionsController.cs`)
- Updated `ApplyHealedScript` endpoint to pass the `executionId` to the service
- This ensures the healing is marked as applied when the user applies it

#### 5. DTO (`TestExecutionDto.cs`)
- Added `ExecutionId` property to `ApplyHealedScriptRequest`
- Allows the UI to specify which execution triggered the healing

#### 6. Tests
- Updated existing tests to set `WasApplied = true` for healing histories that should be protected
- Added comprehensive new test suite (`HealingAppliedTrackingTests.cs`) with 3 tests:
  - Verifies unapplied healings don't cause validation errors
  - Verifies applied healings are protected from being overwritten
  - Verifies the ApplyHealedScript endpoint correctly marks healings as applied

## Workflow After Fix

### Correct Workflow Now:
1. User initiates AI healing for a failed test
2. AI generates a healed script with new locators
3. System saves healing history with `WasSuccessful = true`, `WasApplied = false`
4. **Case A - User applies the healing:**
   - User clicks "Apply Healed Script"
   - System updates test case automation script
   - System finds the healing history record and sets `WasApplied = true`, `AppliedAt = DateTime.UtcNow`
   - Future healings will preserve these locators
5. **Case B - User does NOT apply the healing:**
   - User views the healed script but decides not to apply it
   - Test fails again with the same error
   - User tries to heal again
   - AI does NOT try to preserve the unapplied locators ✓
   - AI can freely generate a different healing approach

## Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ AI tried to preserve locators that were never applied
- ❌ Users had to deal with "ghost" locators constraining the healing
- ❌ Multiple healing attempts became increasingly constrained

### After Fix:
- ✅ AI only preserves locators that were actually applied to test cases
- ✅ Users can review and reject healing suggestions without side effects
- ✅ Each healing attempt is independent if previous healings weren't applied
- ✅ Applied healings are still fully protected from being overwritten

## Testing

All 97 tests pass:
- 94 existing tests (updated to set `WasApplied = true` appropriately)
- 3 new tests specifically for the applied tracking feature

## Database Migration Note

The `HealingHistory` table schema now includes:
- `WasApplied` (bit/boolean)
- `AppliedAt` (datetime, nullable)

The application uses an in-memory database by default in development mode, so the schema will be automatically recreated on next run. For production environments using SQL Server, a migration would need to be created and applied.

## Files Changed

1. `src/SuperQA.Core/Entities/HealingHistory.cs` - Added WasApplied and AppliedAt properties
2. `src/SuperQA.Infrastructure/Services/AITestHealingService.cs` - Updated to use only applied healings
3. `src/SuperQA.Infrastructure/Services/TestExecutionService.cs` - Added logic to mark healings as applied
4. `src/SuperQA.Core/Interfaces/ITestExecutionService.cs` - Updated method signature
5. `src/SuperQA.Api/Controllers/TestExecutionsController.cs` - Pass executionId to service
6. `src/SuperQA.Shared/DTOs/TestExecutionDto.cs` - Added ExecutionId to request DTO
7. `tests/SuperQA.Tests/AIHealingValidationTests.cs` - Updated existing tests
8. `tests/SuperQA.Tests/HealingAppliedTrackingTests.cs` - New comprehensive test suite

## Backward Compatibility

Existing healing history records without `WasApplied` set will default to `false`, which means they won't be used for locator protection. This is safe because:
1. If they were never applied, they shouldn't constrain future healings (correct behavior)
2. If they were applied in the past, the locators are already in the test script, so validation will still work based on the actual script content

The fix is therefore backward compatible and safe to deploy.
