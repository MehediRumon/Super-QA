# AI Healing Protection - Quick Reference

## 🎯 What's New

AI test healing now has **4-layer protection** to ensure accurate, safe healing:

1. ✅ **Preserves Previously Fixed Locators** - Never regresses working fixes
2. ✅ **Rejects Generic Locators** - No more "button", "div", "input" alone
3. ✅ **Validates Element Types** - Buttons heal to buttons, inputs to inputs
4. ✅ **Ensures Completeness** - Scripts must be valid and runnable

## 🚨 Common Validation Errors

### Error: "Previously corrected locator was removed"
**What it means:** AI tried to change a locator that was successfully fixed before

**What to do:**
- Try healing again (AI may respect it the second time)
- Check if the "protected" locator is actually the one causing the new failure
- If so, manually update the test (system allows removing failing locators)

### Error: "Overly generic locator detected"
**What it means:** AI suggested using just "button" or "div" without specifics

**What to do:**
- Try healing with GPT-4 (better at specific locators)
- Manually update with a specific locator like `[data-testid='submit']`

### Error: "Incompatible element type"
**What it means:** AI tried to heal a button with an input locator (or similar mismatch)

**What to do:**
- Try healing again
- Review the error message to understand the expected element type
- Manually fix with correct element type if healing keeps failing

### Error: "Script is incomplete or malformed"
**What it means:** AI returned code that's too short or invalid

**What to do:**
- Try healing again (may be a temporary AI issue)
- Use GPT-4 for more complete responses
- Check if the original test script was very simple (may trigger false positive)

## 💡 Best Practices

### For Best Results
1. **Use GPT-4** - More accurate, better at following preservation rules
2. **Review Before Running** - Check healed script makes sense
3. **Check History** - See what was tried and why it failed
4. **Iterative Healing** - Try 2-3 times if first attempt fails

### Red Flags to Watch For
- ❌ Same test failing healing repeatedly → needs manual review
- ❌ Generic locators appearing → switch to GPT-4
- ❌ Type mismatches → check if original test steps are correct

## 📊 Validation Checklist

When AI heals a test, it checks:

- [ ] All previously healed locators are still present
- [ ] No generic locators like "button", "div", "input" used
- [ ] Element types match (button→button, input→input)
- [ ] Script is complete and valid
- [ ] Script length is reasonable (>20 characters)

**All must pass** for healing to be accepted.

## 🔄 What Happens When Validation Fails

```
Your Test (unchanged)
       ↓
   Try Healing
       ↓
   AI Generates Script
       ↓
   Validation Runs
       ↓
   ❌ FAILS (e.g., generic locator)
       ↓
   Error Shown to User
       ↓
   Failure Logged in History
       ↓
   Test Case UNCHANGED (safe!)
```

You can:
- Try healing again
- Try different AI model
- Fix manually

## 📈 Understanding Healing History

Healing history tracks:
- **Date/Time** - When healing was attempted
- **Success/Failure** - Did it pass validation?
- **Old → New** - What changed (locators and scripts)
- **Error Message** - Why it failed (if it did)

Use history to:
- Debug repeated failures
- See healing patterns
- Learn what works

## 🎓 Example Flow

### Successful Healing ✅
```
1. Submit button fails: "#submit-btn not found"
2. Click "AI Heal", enter API key
3. AI generates: '[data-testid="submit"]'
4. Validation checks:
   - ✅ No protected locators violated
   - ✅ Not generic
   - ✅ Compatible type (button→button)
   - ✅ Complete script
5. Healing accepted & logged
6. You review, then update test case
7. Re-run test → Passes!
```

### Failed Healing (Protection Working) ❌
```
1. Cancel button fails
2. Submit button was fixed last week: '#btn' → '[data-testid="submit"]'
3. Click "AI Heal"
4. AI generates new script but removes '[data-testid="submit"]'
5. Validation detects:
   - ❌ Protected locator '[data-testid="submit"]' missing
6. Healing REJECTED
7. Error shown: "Previously corrected locator was removed..."
8. Test case UNCHANGED (safe!)
9. Try healing again or fix manually
```

## 🔐 Security Notes

- API keys are NEVER stored (as before)
- All validation runs server-side
- Failed healings logged for audit
- No external dependencies for validation
- CodeQL scan: 0 vulnerabilities

## 📞 Quick Support

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Healing always fails | Try GPT-4, check error message |
| "Protected locator removed" | That locator was fixed before, try again |
| "Generic locator" | Use GPT-4 or manually add specific locator |
| "Incompatible type" | Element type mismatch, try again or fix manually |
| Want to see history | Check database `HealingHistories` table |

**Remember**: Protection is designed to keep your tests stable. If healing fails, the original test stays safe and unchanged!
