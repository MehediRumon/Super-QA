# AI Healing Improvement Summary

## Problem Statement
The AI healing process had issues where:
1. AI sometimes selected mismatched elements (e.g., replacing button locators with input locators)
2. AI overwrote previously corrected locators, undoing successful fixes
3. AI made wholesale changes to tests instead of targeted fixes (over-healing)
4. Locator extraction didn't recognize modern Playwright methods

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Incomplete Locator Extraction
The `ExtractLocatorsFromScript` method only extracted basic CSS selectors and missed:
- GetByText, GetByLabel, GetByPlaceholder
- GetByAltText, GetByTitle, GetByTestId
- Other modern Playwright methods

### 2. Limited Element Type Detection
The `ExtractElementTypeFromError` method only detected:
- button, input, link
- Missing: checkbox, radio, select, textarea, image, heading

### 3. No Over-Healing Protection
The system didn't validate if AI changed too many locators at once, allowing AI to rewrite entire tests instead of making surgical fixes.

### 4. Weak AI Instructions
The AI prompt didn't explicitly emphasize:
- Changing only 1-2 locators typically
- Surgical precision over comprehensive refactoring
- Identifying the exact failing locator from error messages

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Locator Extraction (AITestHealingService.cs)
**Before:**
```csharp
var patterns = new[]
{
    @"ClickAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"FillAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"Locator\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"WaitForSelectorAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"GetByRole\([^,]+,\s*new\(\)\s*\{\s*Name\s*=\s*[""']([^""']+)[""']",
};
```

**After:**
```csharp
var patterns = new[]
{
    // Basic selector methods
    @"ClickAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"FillAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"Locator\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"WaitForSelectorAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"QuerySelectorAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"IsVisibleAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"IsEnabledAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"GetAttributeAsync\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    
    // GetBy* methods - extract the search text/name
    @"GetByRole\([^,]+,\s*new\(\)\s*\{\s*Name\s*=\s*[""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"GetByText\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"GetByLabel\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"GetByPlaceholder\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"GetByAltText\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"GetByTitle\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
    @"GetByTestId\([""']([^""']+)[""']",
};
```

**Impact:** AI can now properly recognize and preserve modern Playwright locators.

### 2. Extended Element Type Detection (Both Services)
**Enhanced element types detected:**
- checkbox, radio
- textarea, select/dropdown
- image, heading
- Proper ordering to avoid false positives (e.g., "checkbox" before "button")

**Impact:** Better element type matching prevents mismatched replacements.

### 3. Over-Healing Protection (AITestHealingService.cs)
**New Validation:**
```csharp
// Validation 4: Compare old and new scripts to detect inappropriate wholesale changes
if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(testCase.AutomationScript))
{
    var oldLocators = ExtractLocatorsFromScript(testCase.AutomationScript);
    var newLocators = ExtractLocatorsFromScript(healedScript);
    
    // Check if too many locators were changed (possible sign of over-healing)
    var changedLocators = oldLocators.Except(newLocators).ToList();
    var protectedLocators = healingHistory
        .Where(h => !string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(h.NewLocator))
        .Select(h => h.NewLocator!)
        .ToList();
    
    // Count how many unprotected locators were changed
    var unprotectedChanges = changedLocators
        .Where(loc => !protectedLocators.Contains(loc))
        .Count();
    
    // If more than 50% of unprotected locators changed, it's suspicious
    var totalUnprotectedLocators = oldLocators
        .Where(loc => !protectedLocators.Contains(loc))
        .Count();
    
    if (totalUnprotectedLocators > 0 && 
        unprotectedChanges > totalUnprotectedLocators * 0.5 &&
        unprotectedChanges > 2) // Allow small changes
    {
        return (false,
            $"Healed script changed too many locators ({unprotectedChanges} out of {totalUnprotectedLocators}). " +
            "AI healing should make incremental changes, not rewrite the entire test. " +
            "This may indicate the AI is selecting wrong elements or making inappropriate changes.");
    }
}
```

**Rules:**
- Allows changing â‰¤2 locators regardless of percentage
- Rejects if >50% of unprotected locators changed
- Excludes protected (previously healed) locators from the count

**Impact:** Prevents AI from rewriting entire tests, ensuring surgical fixes.

### 4. Enhanced AI Instructions (AITestHealingService.cs)

**Added to prompt:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ TARGETED HEALING APPROACH:
- Look at the error message and stack trace to identify the EXACT locator that failed
- Change ONLY that specific failing locator or add necessary wait/retry logic
- Keep ALL other locators and code exactly as-is
- Do NOT rewrite working parts of the test
- Do NOT change locators that are not mentioned in the error
- Changing more than 1-2 locators is almost always wrong unless explicitly needed
```

**Updated system message:**
```
(2) You make ONLY incremental changes to fix the specific failure - typically changing just 1-2 lines.
(6) You identify the EXACT failing locator from the error message and change ONLY that locator.
(7) You do NOT rewrite or refactor working parts of the test.
(8) You do NOT change locators that are not mentioned in the error message.
Remember: surgical precision is key - fix only what's broken.
```

**Impact:** AI receives clearer, more explicit instructions about making minimal changes.

### 5. Enhanced LocatorValidationService (LocatorValidationService.cs)

**Improvements:**
- Added recognition for AriaRole variants (Checkbox, Radio, Combobox)
- Added GetByRole method detection
- Extended compatible element type groups
- Better element type hints from locators

**Impact:** More accurate validation of element type compatibility.

## Testing

### New Test Coverage
Added 6 comprehensive tests in `AIHealingImprovementsTests.cs`:

1. **RejectsOverHealing_WhenTooManyLocatorsChanged** - Validates rejection of wholesale changes
2. **AcceptsTargetedHealing_WhenOnlyFailingLocatorChanged** - Validates acceptance of surgical fixes
3. **ExtractsPlaywrightGetByMethods** - Validates GetByText and other methods are recognized
4. **DetectsExtendedElementTypes** - Validates detection of select, checkbox, etc.
5. **AllowsSmallChanges_EvenWhenMultipleLocatorsPresent** - Validates â‰¤2 locator threshold
6. **ProtectsWorkingLocators_InPresenceOfOneFailure** - Validates targeted fix with multiple locators

### Test Results
- **All 87 tests passing** (81 existing + 6 new)
- **CodeQL security scan: 0 vulnerabilities**
- **Build: Successful with existing warnings only**

## Before vs After Comparison

### Scenario: Test with 5 locators, 1 fails

**Before (Problematic):**
- AI changes all 5 locators (over-healing)
- May replace button with input (element mismatch)
- Overwrites previously healed locators
- âœ— Test becomes unstable

**After (Fixed):**
- AI changes only the 1 failing locator
- Element types are validated and protected
- Previously healed locators are preserved
- Over-healing is detected and rejected
- âœ“ Test remains stable with minimal changes

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits
1. **Stability** - Tests remain stable after healing by preserving working code
2. **Accuracy** - Element type validation prevents wrong element selection
3. **Minimal Changes** - Over-healing protection ensures surgical fixes
4. **Better AI Behavior** - Enhanced prompts guide AI to make targeted changes
5. **Maintainability** - Smaller diffs make healing results easier to review

### Risks Mitigated
1. âœ“ Mismatched element selection (button â†’ input)
2. âœ“ Overwriting previously corrected locators
3. âœ“ Wholesale test rewrites (over-healing)
4. âœ“ Missed modern Playwright methods
5. âœ“ Inadequate element type detection

## Files Changed
1. `src/SuperQA.Infrastructure/Services/AITestHealingService.cs` (+72 lines)
2. `src/SuperQA.Infrastructure/Services/LocatorValidationService.cs` (+73 lines)
3. `tests/SuperQA.Tests/AIHealingImprovementsTests.cs` (+454 lines, new file)

**Total:** 3 files changed, 618 insertions(+), 17 deletions(-)

## Backward Compatibility
âœ… All changes are backward compatible:
- No API signature changes
- Existing tests continue to pass
- Additional validation only rejects invalid healed scripts
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Recommendations for Users

### Best Practices
1. Review healing results before applying (already in UI)
2. Monitor healing history to identify patterns
3. Use specific locators (data-testid, role+name) in original tests
4. Verify element types match between old and new locators

### When Healing is Rejected
If healing is rejected with "changed too many locators":
1. Review the error message to identify the specific failure
2. Manually fix the failing locator if needed
3. Retry healing with different AI model (e.g., GPT-4)
4. Consider if test structure needs refactoring

## Conclusion
The implemented improvements address all identified issues with AI healing:
- âœ… Prevents mismatched element selection
- âœ… Protects previously corrected locators
- âœ… Prevents over-healing with validation
- âœ… Recognizes all modern Playwright methods
- âœ… Provides clearer AI instructions

The system now ensures AI healing makes surgical, targeted fixes while preserving working code and preventing inappropriate changes.
